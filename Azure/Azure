Azure

Design an App architrecture Solution:-
Messages vs Events: Events used for broadcasting (concept of publisher vs subscriber). Events lightweight than messages.
Design a messaging Solution:
Azure Queue Storage: To process messages asynchronously. Can be accessed using http/https. Size of messages 64KB. Queue may contain millions of messages and depends on capacity of Storage account.
Azure Service Bus Queues:
Azure Service Bus Publish Subscribe topic: Multiple receivers/destinations for a single message
Design an event Solution:
Event Hub messaging Solution: Supports streaming data. Collect events from real time scenario. Uses pull model.



Design Business Continuity Solution:-
Azure Backup Service: For Azure and Non-Azure Workloads. Azure backup vault vs Azure Recovery Services Vault (Azure key vault is different)
Azure backup vault requires components to be in same region.
GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage) in Azure is a replication option that stores your data in two geographically separated Azure regions, ensuring durability and high availability in the event of a regional outage.
LRS (Locally Redundant Storage) in Azure is a storage replication option that keeps multiple copies of your data within a single Azure region or data center to protect against local hardware failures.

Design for Azure Blob backup and recovery:-
Soft Delete and Versioning option
A Storage Account in Azure is a container that provides access to various Azure storage services, such as Blob, File, Queue, and Table storage
In an Azure Storage Account, a container is a logical grouping within Blob storage that holds blobs, which are files or data objects like images, videos, documents, or backups.
PITR point in time restore for blobs

Azure files backup and recovery:-
With the help of share snapshots
